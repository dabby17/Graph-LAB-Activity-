Application Name: Airline Route Maps ( Graph Data Structure) 

Introduction of Airline Route Maps
	Airline route maps can be modeled using graph data structures, consisting of nodes representing airports and edges representing flight routes between them. Edges can be directed or undirected, and weighted to represent factors like duration, distance, cost, or stops.
 
Describe the Airline Route Maps
         An airline route map graph represents a network of airports connected by flight paths, with the size and complexity varying based on the airline's network. Graph types include simple, weighted, and directed, with each graph representing different aspects of the network The graph representation of airline route maps is useful for route planning, flight scheduling, network analysis, predictive modeling, dynamic pricing, and customer service. It helps identify efficient routes, optimize schedules, analyze network connectivity, forecast passenger demand, adjust ticket prices, and provide customers with information about flight routes and schedules in case of disruptions.
         
Why did you make that kind of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community?
        The graph-based analysis of airline route maps benefits individuals and communities by improving route planning, reducing stress during disruptions, and enhancing the economy through efficient scheduling and network optimization. Predictive modeling aids airlines in resource management, leading to cost savings and improved customer service.
